                            as soon as possible. Most patients diagnosed with Heart Failure are
                            highly likely to have CAD as well, it would be wise to test the patient for
                            CAD as well using the system (if it hasn't been done already).

                    <p>Below are some supplements and foods that can help patients deal with their Heart Failure more effectively (without acting contrary to the standard treament offered by the Doctor)</p>
                    <div class="col">
                        <h3>Coenzyme Q10</h3>
                        <p>
                            Coenzyme Q10: #1 Supplement for Heart Failure patients with congestive heart failure.
                            Normally, CoQ10 concentrations in the heart muscle are 10 times greater than in any other organ. In patients with congestive heart failure, however, the heart cells are deficient in CoQ10, and the energy-starved heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs.
                            Supplemental CoQ10 can help. Clinical studies show that 87% of patients with congestive heart failure improved after taking CoQ10 for six months. For some, the gentle, natural boost to their energy-starved hearts brought dramatic improvements.

                        <h3>D-Ribose</h3>
                        <p>
                            D-ribose is a naturally occurring sugar that is a structural component of ATP.
                            In congestive heart failure, which is marked by cellular energy deficiency, the reduction in ATP production is directly linked with decreased mitochondrial levels of D-ribose.
                            Boosting levels of this essential compound with supplemental D-ribose helps to regenerate much-needed ATP and enables the heart muscles to produce energy faster. Studies have shown that 
                            daily oral D-ribose significantly improved heart function, exercise endurance, and quality of life in patients with heart failure.
